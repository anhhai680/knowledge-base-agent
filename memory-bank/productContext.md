# Product Context: Knowledge Base Agent

## Why This Project Exists

The Knowledge Base Agent addresses a critical pain point in software development: **code comprehension at scale**. As codebases grow larger and more complex, developers spend increasing amounts of time trying to understand:

- How specific features are implemented
- Where to find relevant code for bug fixes
- What dependencies exist between components
- How to properly use internal APIs and libraries
- The reasoning behind architectural decisions

Traditional code search tools (grep, IDE search, GitHub search) are limited to exact matches and lack semantic understanding. Developers need an intelligent assistant that can understand natural language questions about code and provide contextual, accurate answers. The system now goes beyond text-based responses to provide **visual code analysis through automatic sequence diagram generation**, significantly enhancing the developer experience.

## Problems We Solve

### 1. Code Discovery & Understanding ✅ ENHANCED
**Problem**: "I need to understand how authentication works in this microservice, but there are 50+ files and I don't know where to start."

**Solution**: Ask "How does user authentication work?" and get a comprehensive answer with relevant code snippets from the right files, explanation of the flow, and links to specific implementations. **NEW**: Ask "Show me a sequence diagram for authentication" and get a visual representation of the authentication flow.

### 2. Cross-Repository Knowledge ✅ ENHANCED
**Problem**: "Our organization has 20+ repositories with shared patterns, but finding examples of how to implement feature X is time-consuming."

**Solution**: Index multiple repositories and ask "Show me examples of how rate limiting is implemented across our services" to get comparative examples and best practices. **NEW**: Generate visual sequence diagrams showing how rate limiting flows through different services.

### 3. Onboarding New Developers ✅ ENHANCED
**Problem**: "New team members take weeks to become productive because they need to understand the codebase architecture and conventions."

**Solution**: Provide an intelligent assistant that can answer questions like "What's the testing strategy?" or "How do I add a new API endpoint?" with specific, actionable guidance. **NEW**: Visual diagrams showing the flow of common operations and system interactions.

### 4. Code Review Context ✅ ENHANCED
**Problem**: "During code reviews, I need to understand the broader context of changes but don't have time to explore the entire codebase."

**Solution**: Ask contextual questions about the code being reviewed to understand its impact, dependencies, and relationship to existing functionality. **NEW**: Visual diagrams showing how the reviewed code fits into the broader system architecture.

### 5. Documentation Gaps ✅ ENHANCED
**Problem**: "The code is the documentation, but understanding complex business logic requires reading through hundreds of lines across multiple files."

**Solution**: Generate natural language explanations of complex code sections, business logic, and system interactions on demand. **NEW**: Visual diagrams automatically generated from code analysis, providing immediate visual understanding of complex flows.

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

1. **Setup & Configuration**
   - User provides GitHub repository URLs and API credentials
   - System indexes repositories in background (5-10 minutes for typical repo)
   - User receives confirmation when indexing is complete

2. **Natural Language Querying**
   - User asks questions in plain English: "How does the payment processing work?"
   - System retrieves relevant code snippets, documentation, and comments
   - AI generates comprehensive answer with source file references
   - **NEW**: For appropriate queries, system automatically generates sequence diagrams
   - User can ask follow-up questions for deeper understanding

3. **Visual Code Analysis** ✅ NEW CAPABILITY
   - User requests visual analysis: "Show me a sequence diagram for user registration"
   - System analyzes code interactions and generates Mermaid sequence diagram
   - Diagram rendered directly in chat interface with source attribution
   - User can export diagrams or ask for modifications

4. **Continuous Learning**
   - System can re-index repositories when code changes
   - User feedback helps improve answer quality over time
   - New repositories can be added without affecting existing indexed content

        3. Payment Service (src/services/payment/) - Processes transactions
        4. Database Layer (src/db/) - PostgreSQL with Redis caching
