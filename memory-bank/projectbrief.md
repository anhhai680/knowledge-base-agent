# Project Brief: Knowledge Base Agent

## Project Overview

The Knowledge Base Agent is an AI-powered RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that enables users to index GitHub repositories and answer questions about codebases using natural language. It serves as an intelligent knowledge base that can understand, search, and provide contextual answers about source code and documentation.

## Core Mission

Create a production-ready, multi-LLM knowledge base agent that can:
- Index GitHub repositories efficiently
- Provide accurate, context-aware answers about code
- Support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Azure OpenAI, Ollama)
- Offer flexible deployment options (Docker, local development)
- Scale to handle large codebases and multiple users

## Primary Goals

### 1. Code Understanding & Indexing
- **Repository Integration**: Seamlessly connect to GitHub repositories (public and private)
- **Intelligent Chunking**: Process code files with appropriate text chunking strategies
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintain file paths, repository context, and code structure information
- **Incremental Updates**: Support updating indexed repositories without full re-indexing

### 2. Intelligent Question Answering
- **Contextual RAG**: Retrieve relevant code snippets and documentation for user queries
- **Multi-modal Understanding**: Handle questions about code structure, functionality, and documentation
- **Source Attribution**: Provide file references and line numbers for answers
- **Code-aware Responses**: Format answers with proper code syntax highlighting

### 3. Multi-LLM Flexibility
- **Provider Agnostic**: Support OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Azure OpenAI, and Ollama models
- **Easy Model Switching**: Simple configuration system to change LLM and embedding models
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when primary models are unavailable
- **Performance Optimization**: Automatic model selection based on query complexity

### 4. Production Readiness
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker and Docker Compose support for easy deployment
- **REST API**: Full-featured API for programmatic access
- **Web Interface**: Simple chat interface for end users
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Comprehensive logging and health check endpoints
- **Data Persistence**: Reliable vector store persistence across restarts

## Key Technologies

- **Framework**: Python 3.11+ with LangChain for RAG pipeline
- **Vector Store**: ChromaDB for semantic search and embeddings storage
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI for REST API with async support
- **Frontend**: HTML/JavaScript simple chat interface
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with Docker Compose orchestration
- **Code Integration**: GitHub API integration for repository access

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **Indexing Performance**: Index a medium-sized repository (1000+ files) in under 5 minutes
2. **Query Accuracy**: Provide relevant answers for 90%+ of code-related questions
3. **Response Time**: Average query response time under 3 seconds
4. **Model Flexibility**: Support switching between all major LLM providers without data migration

### Technical Requirements
1. **Scalability**: Handle multiple concurrent users and repositories
2. **Reliability**: 99%+ uptime with proper error handling and recovery
3. **Maintainability**: Clean, documented code following Python best practices
4. **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for adding new document loaders and processors

### User Experience
1. **Ease of Setup**: Single command deployment with Docker Compose
2. **Intuitive API**: RESTful API with clear documentation and examples
3. **Clear Responses**: Well-formatted answers with source attribution
4. **Error Handling**: Helpful error messages and troubleshooting guidance

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Software Developers**: Exploring unfamiliar codebases or seeking specific implementation patterns
- **Technical Writers**: Creating documentation and understanding code functionality
- **Code Reviewers**: Getting quick context about code changes and implementations
- **DevOps Engineers**: Understanding system architecture and deployment configurations

### Secondary Users
- **Engineering Managers**: Getting high-level insights about codebase structure and complexity
- **QA Engineers**: Understanding code functionality for test case development
- **Open Source Contributors**: Quickly understanding project structure and contribution guidelines

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- GitHub repository indexing and search
- Multi-LLM provider support with easy switching
- REST API for programmatic access
- Basic web interface for user interaction
- Docker-based deployment and development
- Comprehensive documentation and setup guides

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Advanced authentication and user management
- Integration with other version control systems (GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Advanced analytics and usage tracking
- Enterprise features (SSO, audit logs, multi-tenancy)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Mobile applications

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with standard Python packaging and dependency management
- Vector store must support semantic search with configurable embedding models
- API responses must be JSON-formatted for easy integration
- Container images must be reasonably sized for deployment efficiency

### Business Constraints
- Open source project with permissive licensing
- No vendor lock-in to specific LLM or cloud providers
- Cost-conscious design supporting both cloud and local deployment options

### Assumptions
- Users have basic familiarity with Git and GitHub
- Deployment environments have internet access for downloading models and dependencies
- Users can provide necessary API keys for their chosen LLM providers
- GitHub repositories follow standard file structure conventions
