# Active Context: Knowledge Base Agent

## Current Focus

**Primary Objective**: Maintaining and improving the production-ready Knowledge Base Agent with focus on user experience enhancements and system reliability.

**Recent Development Context**: The system is currently deployed and functional with a working MVP that successfully indexes GitHub repositories and provides intelligent code Q&A capabilities. The focus has shifted from initial development to optimization and enhancement.

## Current Branch Context

**Branch**: `feat_format_answer_friendly`
**Purpose**: Enhancing the user experience by improving the formatting and presentation of answers returned by the RAG agent.

**Key Focus Areas**:
1. **Answer Formatting**: Making responses more readable and user-friendly
2. **Source Attribution**: Improving how source code references are presented
3. **Code Highlighting**: Better syntax highlighting in responses
4. **Response Structure**: Organizing answers in a more logical, scannable format

### Currently Working On
- 🔄 **Answer Formatting Enhancement**: Improving readability and structure of responses
- 🔄 **User Experience Polish**: Making the system more intuitive for end users
- 🔄 **Response Optimization**: Better formatting of code snippets and technical explanations

### Next Immediate Priorities
- 📋 **Memory Bank Documentation**: Establishing comprehensive project memory (THIS TASK)
- 📋 **Response Template Refinement**: Creating templates for different types of queries
- 📋 **Error Message Improvement**: Making error messages more actionable
- 📋 **Performance Monitoring**: Adding metrics for response quality and speed

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### 1. Response Formatting Strategy
**Decision Context**: Current responses are functional but could be more user-friendly
**Options Considered**:
- Markdown formatting for better structure
- Code block highlighting with language detection
- Progressive disclosure (summary → details)
- Source reference formatting improvements

**Current Direction**: Enhanced markdown formatting with better code highlighting and structured source attribution

### 2. User Interface Evolution
**Decision Context**: Basic HTML interface serves MVP needs but could be enhanced
**Considerations**:
- Keep simple interface vs. add complexity
- Focus on API-first development vs. UI improvements
- Balance between functionality and simplicity

**Current Direction**: Gradual UI improvements while maintaining API-first approach

### 3. Performance vs. Quality Trade-offs
**Decision Context**: Balancing response speed with answer quality
**Active Considerations**:
- Chunk retrieval count (more context vs. faster responses)
- LLM model selection per query type
- Caching strategies for frequent queries

**Current Direction**: Quality-first approach with optional performance optimizations

## Development Workflow Status

### Current Development Environment
- **Local Setup**: Functional with all components working
- **Docker Environment**: Stable with proper persistence
- **Model Configuration**: All providers tested and working
