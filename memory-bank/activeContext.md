## Active Decisions & Considerations

### 1. Sequence Diagram Feature Strategy
**Decision Context**: Successfully implemented comprehensive visual code analysis capability
**Implementation Completed**:
- Agent router pattern for intelligent query routing
- Multi-language code analysis (Python AST, JS/TS/C# regex)
- Mermaid sequence diagram generation
- Web interface integration with Mermaid.js rendering
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality

**Current Direction**: Feature complete and ready for production use

### 2. Response Enhancement Strategy
**Decision Context**: System now supports both text and visual responses
**Recent Achievement**: 
- Enhanced API models to support diagram responses
- Intelligent routing between text and diagram agents
- Comprehensive error handling for diagram generation failures
- Progressive disclosure with source attribution for both response types

**Current Direction**: Dual-mode response system (text + diagrams) successfully implemented

### 3. Performance vs. Quality Trade-offs
**Decision Context**: Balancing response speed with answer quality
**Active Considerations**:
- Chunk retrieval count (more context vs. faster responses)
- LLM model selection per query type
- Caching strategies for frequent queries

**Current Direction**: Quality-first approach with optional performance optimizations

## Development Workflow Status
