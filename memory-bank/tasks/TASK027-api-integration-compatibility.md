# [TASK027] - API Integration and Compatibility Layer

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 15, 2025  
**Updated:** August 15, 2025

## Original Request
Implement the API integration and compatibility layer that ensures LangGraph agents work seamlessly with existing FastAPI endpoints while maintaining identical interfaces.

## Thought Process
The PRD emphasizes maintaining zero breaking changes through:

1. Identical API interfaces between LangChain and LangGraph agents
2. Seamless integration with existing FastAPI routes
3. Transparent switching between systems
4. Backward compatibility for all endpoints
5. API versioning for future enhancements

This layer is crucial for maintaining user experience during migration.

## Implementation Plan
- Update agent router to support LangGraph agents
- Ensure identical response formats
- Implement transparent system switching
- Add API versioning support
- Create compatibility validation tests
- Update existing API routes
- Add migration status endpoints

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Not Started - 0%
