# TASK026: Enhance Diagram Detection Logic

**Status:** Not Started  
**Added:** August 19, 2025  
**Updated:** August 19, 2025  
**Phase:** 1.2 - Immediate Fixes
**Parent Task:** TASK024

## Original Request
Enhance diagram detection logic in `src/agents/agent_router.py` by improving the `_is_diagram_request` method, adding mermaid-specific detection, enhancing keyword combination analysis, and adding context-aware flow detection.

## Thought Process
The current diagram detection logic is basic and misses many valid diagram requests:

1. **Limited Detection Scope**: Only catches obvious diagram keywords
2. **No Mermaid Priority**: Mermaid-specific requests not prioritized
3. **Weak Context Analysis**: Poor understanding of contextual diagram requests
4. **Missing Flow Detection**: Context-aware flow requests not detected

Enhanced detection logic will significantly improve user experience and system accuracy.

## Implementation Plan
- **Step 1**: Analyze current detection logic limitations
- **Step 2**: Improve `_is_diagram_request` method structure
- **Step 3**: Add mermaid-specific detection strategies
- **Step 4**: Enhance keyword combination analysis
- **Step 5**: Implement context-aware flow detection
- **Step 6**: Test with diverse query patterns
