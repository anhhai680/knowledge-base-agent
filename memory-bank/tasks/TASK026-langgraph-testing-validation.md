# [TASK026] - LangGraph Testing and Validation Framework

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 15, 2025  
**Updated:** August 15, 2025

## Original Request
Implement comprehensive testing framework for LangGraph components including unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks, and workflow validation.

## Thought Process
The PRD specifies extensive testing requirements that:

1. Achieve 90%+ code coverage for new LangGraph components
2. Provide comprehensive integration testing
3. Include performance benchmarking against current system
4. Support load testing with 10x current capacity
5. Validate workflow execution and error handling

This testing framework ensures quality and reliability of the LangGraph implementation.

## Implementation Plan
- Create unit test suite for all LangGraph components
- Build integration testing framework
- Implement performance benchmarking system
- Set up load testing infrastructure
- Create workflow validation tests
- Add error scenario testing
- Integrate continuous testing pipeline

## Progress Tracking
