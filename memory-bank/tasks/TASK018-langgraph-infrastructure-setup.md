# [TASK018] - LangGraph Infrastructure Setup

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 15, 2025  
**Updated:** August 15, 2025

## Original Request
Set up the core LangGraph infrastructure as the foundation for the parallel system implementation, including dependencies, base classes, and configuration management.

## Thought Process
This task focuses on establishing the fundamental infrastructure needed for LangGraph integration. Based on the PRD, we need to:

1. Install and configure LangGraph dependencies
2. Create base classes for workflow management
3. Set up state management foundations
4. Establish configuration for parallel system operation
5. Create the basic project structure for LangGraph components

This is the foundation task that all other LangGraph tasks will depend on.

## Implementation Plan
- Install LangGraph dependencies and verify compatibility
- Create base workflow state classes (BaseWorkflowState, WorkflowStatus enum)
- Implement BaseGraphAgent class for LangGraph agents
- Set up graph configuration management (GraphConfig)
- Create checkpoint system infrastructure
- Establish parallel system routing mechanism
- Set up feature flag system for migration control
