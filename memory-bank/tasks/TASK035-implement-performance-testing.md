# TASK035: Implement Performance Testing

**Status:** Not Started  
**Added:** August 19, 2025  
**Updated:** August 19, 2025  
**Phase:** 4.3 - Testing and Validation
**Parent Task:** TASK024

## Original Request
Implement comprehensive performance testing covering pattern detection speed, diagram generation time, memory usage, and response quality scores to ensure the enhanced diagram system meets performance requirements.

## Thought Process
Performance testing ensures the enhanced diagram system maintains acceptable performance standards:

1. **Detection Speed**: Pattern detection must be fast (<100ms)
2. **Generation Time**: Diagram generation within acceptable limits (<10s)
3. **Memory Usage**: Reasonable memory consumption (<500MB)
4. **Quality Scores**: Maintain high response quality (>8.5/10)

Performance validation ensures the enhancements don't degrade system performance.

## Implementation Plan
- **Step 1**: Define performance benchmarks
- **Step 2**: Implement pattern detection speed tests
- **Step 3**: Create diagram generation time tests
- **Step 4**: Add memory usage monitoring
- **Step 5**: Implement response quality scoring
- **Step 6**: Performance regression testing
