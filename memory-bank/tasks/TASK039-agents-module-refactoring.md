# [TASK039] - Agents Module Refactoring

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 22, 2025  
**Updated:** August 22, 2025

## Original Request
Phase 2, Step 2.1 of the Agents Refactoring Implementation Plan: Break down large agent files and implement unified interfaces to reduce complexity and improve maintainability.

## Thought Process
This task addresses the largest files in the codebase that exceed 500+ lines:

**Current State:**
- `diagram_agent.py`: 1,126 lines → 200 lines
- `rag_agent.py`: 835 lines → 200 lines  
- `response_quality_enhancer.py`: 792 lines → distributed across quality/ module
- `query_optimizer.py`: 627 lines → distributed across optimization/ module

**New Architecture:**
- Modular organization: rag/, diagram/, optimization/, quality/, shared/
- Specialized components with single responsibilities
- Advanced RAG features preserved: Chain-of-Thought, ReAct, query optimization
- Performance enhancements: caching, monitoring, error handling

Target: Reduce ~2,500+ lines through better organization and eliminate duplication.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create new agents/ module structure with specialized subdirectories
2. Refactor RAG agent into focused components
3. Restructure diagram agent with generators and enhancers
4. Break down query optimizer into strategies and analyzers
5. Reorganize quality enhancer into validators and metrics
6. Implement agent factory and unified routing
