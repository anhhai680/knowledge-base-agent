# TASK031: Update Agent Router Integration

**Status:** Not Started  
**Added:** August 19, 2025  
**Updated:** August 19, 2025  
**Phase:** 3.1 - Integration and Migration
**Parent Task:** TASK024

## Original Request
Update the Agent Router in `src/agents/agent_router.py` to integrate the new `DiagramAgent` alongside the existing `DiagramHandler`, update routing logic to use the new agent, and maintain backward compatibility.

## Thought Process
The Agent Router needs to be updated to utilize the new DiagramAgent while maintaining system stability:

1. **Dual Agent Support**: Support both old DiagramHandler and new DiagramAgent
2. **Routing Logic Update**: Intelligent routing to appropriate agent
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality continues working
4. **Gradual Migration**: Allow for gradual transition to new agent

This integration will enable the new capabilities while ensuring system reliability.

## Implementation Plan
- **Step 1**: Design integration architecture
- **Step 2**: Add DiagramAgent initialization
- **Step 3**: Update routing logic for dual agents
- **Step 4**: Implement backward compatibility layer
- **Step 5**: Add configuration for agent selection
- **Step 6**: Test integration thoroughly

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Not Started - 0%

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
