# TASK031: Update Agent Router Integration

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** August 19, 2025  
**Updated:** August 19, 2025  
**Phase:** 3.1 - Integration and Migration
**Parent Task:** TASK024

## Original Request
Update the Agent Router in `src/agents/agent_router.py` to integrate the new `DiagramAgent` alongside the existing `DiagramHandler`, update routing logic to use the new agent, and maintain backward compatibility.

## Thought Process
The Agent Router needs to be updated to utilize the new DiagramAgent while maintaining system stability:

1. **Dual Agent Support**: Support both old DiagramHandler and new DiagramAgent
2. **Routing Logic Update**: Intelligent routing to appropriate agent
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality continues working
4. **Gradual Migration**: Allow for gradual transition to new agent

This integration will enable the new capabilities while ensuring system reliability.

## Implementation Plan
- **Step 1**: Design integration architecture ✅
- **Step 2**: Add DiagramAgent initialization ✅
- **Step 3**: Update routing logic for dual agents ✅
- **Step 4**: Implement backward compatibility layer ✅
- **Step 5**: Add configuration for agent selection ✅
- **Step 6**: Test integration thoroughly ✅

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Target Files
- `src/agents/agent_router.py` (primary) ✅
- `src/api/routes.py` (initialization updates) ✅
- `src/config/agent_config.py` (new configuration) ✅
- `tests/test_agent_router_integration.py` (testing) ✅

## Success Criteria
- ✅ DiagramAgent successfully integrated with router
- ✅ Routing logic updated for dual-agent support
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Configuration system for agent selection
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ New capabilities accessible through router

## Implementation Details

### AgentRouter Enhancements
1. **Constructor Changes**: Added optional `diagram_agent` and `agent_config` parameters
2. **Agent Selection Logic**: Implemented `_select_diagram_agent()` with intelligent routing
3. **Query Complexity Analysis**: Added `_is_complex_diagram_request()` for auto-selection
4. **Unified Interface**: Created `_generate_with_agent()` for consistent agent interaction
5. **Fallback Mechanism**: Implemented `_attempt_fallback_diagram_generation()`

### Configuration System
1. **AgentConfig Class**: Comprehensive configuration for agent routing
2. **DiagramAgentType Enum**: DIAGRAM_HANDLER, DIAGRAM_AGENT, AUTO options
3. **Configuration Presets**: legacy, modern, hybrid presets for different use cases
4. **Auto-Selection Criteria**: Complex query detection based on keywords and patterns

### Integration Features
1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work unchanged
2. **Graceful Degradation**: System works even if DiagramAgent fails to initialize
3. **Enhanced Capabilities**: New DiagramAgent features accessible when available
4. **Fallback Support**: Automatic fallback between agents on failure

### Testing
- Core integration tests: 4/4 passing
- Backward compatibility verified
- Agent selection logic validated
- API integration confirmed

## Progress Log
### August 19, 2025
- ✅ Created task to track agent router integration
- ✅ Analyzed current AgentRouter and DiagramHandler implementation
- ✅ Designed dual-agent architecture with intelligent selection
- ✅ Implemented AgentConfig with routing preferences and presets
- ✅ Updated AgentRouter constructor for backward compatibility
- ✅ Added intelligent agent selection based on query complexity
- ✅ Implemented unified interface for both agent types
- ✅ Added fallback mechanism for enhanced reliability
- ✅ Updated routes.py initialization with enhanced DiagramAgent
- ✅ Created comprehensive integration tests
- ✅ Verified backward compatibility and new functionality
- ✅ Completed successful end-to-end integration testing

**Final Status**: Task completed successfully. Agent router now supports dual diagram agents with intelligent routing, backward compatibility, and enhanced capabilities.
