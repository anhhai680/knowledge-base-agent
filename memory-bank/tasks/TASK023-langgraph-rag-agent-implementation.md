# [TASK023] - LangGraph RAG Agent Implementation

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 15, 2025  
**Updated:** August 15, 2025

## Original Request
Implement the main LangGraph RAG agent that replaces the current LangChain RAG agent while maintaining identical API interfaces for zero breaking changes.

## Thought Process
The PRD emphasizes creating a parallel LangGraph agent that:

1. Maintains identical API interfaces to the current LangChain agent
2. Integrates all LangGraph workflows (chunking, embedding, query)
3. Supports the same multi-LLM capabilities
4. Provides enhanced performance and error handling
5. Enables seamless switching between systems

This is the user-facing component that orchestrates all workflows.

## Implementation Plan
- Create LangGraphRAGAgent class with identical interface
- Integrate chunking, embedding, and query workflows
- Implement multi-LLM support (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Azure)
- Add enhanced error handling and recovery
- Set up performance monitoring and metrics
- Create API compatibility layer
- Add workflow orchestration and state management
