# [TASK022] - Master Orchestrator Implementation

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 15, 2025  
**Updated:** August 15, 2025

## Original Request
Implement the master workflow orchestrator that coordinates all LangGraph workflows with dependency management, parallel execution, and error recovery capabilities.

## Thought Process
The PRD specifies a master orchestrator that:

1. Manages workflow dependencies and execution order
2. Supports parallel execution of independent workflows
3. Provides comprehensive error handling and recovery
4. Implements workflow state coordination
5. Includes checkpointing and progress tracking

This is the central coordination system that ties all workflows together.

## Implementation Plan
- Create OrchestrationState class for workflow coordination
- Implement workflow dependency validation
- Build parallel workflow execution engine
- Create error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Set up master orchestrator graph
- Add workflow progress tracking and checkpointing
- Integrate comprehensive monitoring and logging

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Not Started - 0%
