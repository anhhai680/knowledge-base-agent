# [TASK015] - Tree-sitter Integration for Enhanced Parsing

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 13, 2025  
**Updated:** August 13, 2025

## Original Request
Generate a comprehensive implementation plan to use tree-sitter for parsing C#, JavaScript, and TypeScript to improve the current chunking system's accuracy and robustness.

## Thought Process
The current enhanced chunking system has some limitations:

1. **C# Parsing**: Currently uses regex-based parsing which is fragile for complex C# syntax like generics, LINQ expressions, attributes, and XML documentation
2. **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Not yet implemented - the plan mentions them but they're missing from the current implementation
3. **Parsing Accuracy**: Regex patterns can fail with complex nested structures, comments, and modern language features
4. **Maintainability**: Each language requires custom regex patterns that are hard to maintain and extend

Tree-sitter offers significant advantages:
- **Unified Framework**: Single parsing approach for all languages
- **Accuracy**: Precise syntax tree parsing vs. fragile regex matching
- **Robustness**: Better error handling and recovery from malformed code
- **Performance**: Incremental parsing and efficient tree updates
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new languages with existing tree-sitter grammars

The implementation plan focuses on:
1. **Infrastructure**: Setting up tree-sitter base classes and configuration
2. **Language Implementation**: Creating parsers for C#, JavaScript, and TypeScript
3. **Integration**: Updating existing chunkers and adding new ones
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive validation and performance benchmarking
5. **Migration**: Safe deployment with fallback mechanisms

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)
