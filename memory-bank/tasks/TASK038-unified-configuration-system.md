# [TASK038] - Unified Configuration System

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 22, 2025  
**Updated:** August 22, 2025

## Original Request
Phase 1, Step 1.3 of the Agents Refactoring Implementation Plan: Create unified configuration system to consolidate scattered configuration logic and establish centralized management.

## Thought Process
This task addresses the scattered configuration management across the codebase by creating:

1. **Centralized Configuration Management**: Single source of truth for all configuration
2. **Environment-Specific Configs**: Development, production, and testing presets
3. **RAG-Specific Configuration**: Specialized configuration for RAG operations and performance
4. **Validation System**: Schema-based configuration validation to prevent errors
5. **Hierarchical Structure**: Logical organization with managers/, schemas/, presets/, and validators/

The unified system will eliminate configuration duplication and provide consistent interfaces for all components.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create `src/config/` module with organized subdirectories
2. Implement ConfigManager for centralized configuration handling
3. Create configuration schemas for validation
4. Develop environment-specific presets
5. Implement RAG-specific configuration management
6. Add validation and error handling
