# [TASK025] - Migration Framework and Feature Flags

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 15, 2025  
**Updated:** August 15, 2025

## Original Request
Implement the migration framework with feature flags, A/B testing capabilities, and rollback mechanisms to enable safe, gradual migration from LangChain to LangGraph.

## Thought Process
The PRD emphasizes a zero-downtime migration approach that:

1. Enables feature flags to switch between LangChain and LangGraph
2. Supports A/B testing for gradual user migration
3. Provides automatic rollback based on performance metrics
4. Includes migration tracking and monitoring
5. Ensures zero breaking changes during transition

This framework is critical for risk mitigation during the migration process.

## Implementation Plan
- Create feature flag system for system selection
- Implement A/B testing framework
- Build automatic rollback mechanisms
- Set up migration tracking and analytics
- Create system routing logic
- Add performance-based switching
- Integrate rollback procedures and safety checks
