# [TASK020] - Embedding Workflow Implementation

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 15, 2025  
**Updated:** August 15, 2025

## Original Request
Implement the LangGraph-based embedding workflow with multi-model parallel processing, adaptive strategy selection, and content-specific optimization.

## Thought Process
The PRD specifies an enhanced embedding workflow that:

1. Analyzes content characteristics to select optimal embedding strategy
2. Supports parallel multi-model embedding generation
3. Implements quality-based model selection
4. Provides content-specific optimizations (code, diagrams, general)
5. Includes batch processing and error handling

This replaces the current provider-centric approach with an intelligent, adaptive system.

## Implementation Plan
- Create EmbeddingState class with performance metrics
- Implement content analysis for strategy selection
- Build parallel multi-model embedding generation
- Create embedding quality assessment and selection
- Add content-specific optimizations
- Set up embedding workflow graph
- Integrate performance monitoring and error handling
