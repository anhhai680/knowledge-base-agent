## Task Description

Enhance the current basic RAG implementation with advanced reasoning capabilities to significantly improve response quality, user experience, and system intelligence. The current RAG agent uses a simple RetrievalQA chain, and this task will implement advanced patterns including Chain-of-Thought reasoning, ReAct agents, query analysis, and context refinement.

## Current State Analysis

### What Currently Exists
- **Basic RetrievalQA Chain**: Simple LangChain RetrievalQA implementation
- **Custom Prompts**: Enhanced prompt engineering through PromptComponents
- **Source Attribution**: Returns source documents with responses
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Dual Chain Support**: Handles both legacy and new LangChain formats

### What's Missing
- **Advanced Reasoning**: No Chain-of-Thought or multi-step reasoning
- **Query Analysis**: No query intent classification or optimization
- **Context Refinement**: No iterative context building or improvement
- **Response Quality**: No response validation or enhancement loops
- **Tool Usage**: No external tool or API calling capabilities
