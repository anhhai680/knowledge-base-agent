# TASK024: Diagram Enhancement Implementation

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** August 19, 2025  
**Updated:** August 19, 2025

## Original Request
Implement comprehensive diagram enhancement plan to improve diagram generation capabilities, fix technical issues in pattern compilation, and enhance mermaid support based on the detailed implementation plan document.

## Thought Process
The current diagram generation system has several technical issues that need immediate attention:

1. **Pattern Compilation Issues**: Duplicate regex patterns and inconsistent escaping in `_compile_diagram_patterns`
2. **Limited Mermaid Support**: Basic detection but limited enhancement capabilities  
3. **Architecture Improvements**: Need better separation between detection and generation logic
4. **Enhanced User Experience**: Better formatting and response structure for diagram requests

This work follows the comprehensive plan in `docs/diagram-enhancement-implementation-plan.md` and addresses immediate technical debt before implementing larger architectural changes.

## Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1**: Immediate Fixes (Week 1) - Fix current issues and improve existing functionality
- **Phase 2**: Architecture Enhancement (Week 2) - Create dedicated DiagramAgent
- **Phase 3**: Feature Expansion (Week 3) - Multiple diagram types and advanced features
- **Phase 4**: Integration & Testing (Week 4) - Full integration and comprehensive testing

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 75% (Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 Started)
