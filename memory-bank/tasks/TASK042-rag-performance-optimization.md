# [TASK042] - RAG Performance Optimization

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 22, 2025  
**Updated:** August 22, 2025

## Original Request
Phase 3, Step 3.1 of the Agents Refactoring Implementation Plan: Implement RAG-specific performance optimization with caching, monitoring, and advanced processing strategies.

## Thought Process
This task focuses on optimizing RAG operations for performance and quality:

**Performance Targets:**
- Query response time: <2 seconds for 95th percentile (target: <1.5s average)
- Cache hit rate: >70% for frequently accessed queries
- Error rate: <1% for all query types
- Memory usage: <50MB increase for extended operations

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Advanced caching system for queries, context, and responses
- Performance monitoring with real-time metrics
- Multi-strategy retrieval (semantic, keyword, hybrid)
- Async processing for parallel operations
- Quality scoring and optimization

Target: Significantly improve RAG performance while maintaining response quality.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create performance optimization framework
2. Implement advanced RAG caching system
3. Add comprehensive performance monitoring
4. Optimize context retrieval strategies
5. Implement async processing capabilities
