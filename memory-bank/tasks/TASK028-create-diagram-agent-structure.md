# TASK028: Create Diagram Agent Structure

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Added:** August 19, 2025  
**Updated:** August 19, 2025  
**Phase:** 2.1 - Diagram Agent Creation
**Parent Task:** TASK024

## Original Request
Create the core structure for a dedicated `DiagramAgent` class in `src/agents/diagram_agent.py` with enhanced capabilities, integration with query optimizer and response enhancer, support for multiple diagram types, and enhanced code retrieval methods.

## Thought Process
The current `DiagramHandler` mixes processing and agent logic, limiting extensibility:

1. **Architecture Separation**: Need dedicated agent for diagram generation
2. **Enhanced Integration**: Better integration with existing advanced RAG components
3. **Multi-Type Support**: Foundation for supporting multiple diagram types
4. **Scalable Design**: Extensible architecture for future enhancements

A dedicated `DiagramAgent` will provide a clean architecture foundation for advanced diagram generation capabilities.

## Implementation Plan
- **Step 1**: Design DiagramAgent class structure
- **Step 2**: Implement core agent initialization
- **Step 3**: Integrate with query optimizer
- **Step 4**: Integrate with response enhancer
- **Step 5**: Add multi-diagram type foundation
- **Step 6**: Implement enhanced code retrieval structure

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** âœ… COMPLETED - 100%
