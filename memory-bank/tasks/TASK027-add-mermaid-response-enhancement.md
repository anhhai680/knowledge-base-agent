# TASK027: Add Mermaid Response Enhancement

**Status:** Not Started  
**Added:** August 19, 2025  
**Updated:** August 19, 2025  
**Phase:** 1.3 - Immediate Fixes
**Parent Task:** TASK024

## Original Request
Add mermaid response enhancement functionality in `src/agents/agent_router.py` by implementing `_is_mermaid_specific_request` method, creating `_enhance_mermaid_response` method, adding usage instructions and tips, and improving response formatting.

## Thought Process
Current mermaid responses lack enhancement and user guidance:

1. **No Mermaid Detection**: Cannot identify mermaid-specific requests
2. **Basic Response Format**: No enhanced formatting for mermaid outputs
3. **Missing Instructions**: No usage instructions or tips for users
4. **Poor User Experience**: Users don't know how to use generated mermaid code

Enhanced mermaid responses will provide users with actionable, well-formatted outputs and clear instructions.

## Implementation Plan
- **Step 1**: Implement `_is_mermaid_specific_request` method
- **Step 2**: Create `_enhance_mermaid_response` method
- **Step 3**: Add comprehensive usage instructions
- **Step 4**: Improve response formatting structure
- **Step 5**: Add diagram-type specific tips
- **Step 6**: Test mermaid response enhancement
