# [TASK024] - Performance Monitoring and Observability System

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 15, 2025  
**Updated:** August 15, 2025

## Original Request
Implement comprehensive performance monitoring and observability system for LangGraph workflows, including metrics collection, workflow tracking, and performance analysis.

## Thought Process
The PRD emphasizes the need for comprehensive monitoring that:

1. Tracks workflow execution times and performance metrics
2. Monitors memory usage and resource consumption
3. Provides real-time workflow visibility
4. Supports performance comparison between systems
5. Enables automatic rollback based on performance thresholds

This system is critical for successful migration and ongoing system health.

## Implementation Plan
- Create WorkflowMonitor class for comprehensive tracking
- Implement metric collection (counters, gauges, histograms)
- Build workflow performance analysis
- Create automated alert system
- Set up performance comparison framework
- Add memory and resource monitoring
- Integrate with existing logging systems
