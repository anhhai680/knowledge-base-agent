# [TASK040] - Processors Module Refactoring

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 22, 2025  
**Updated:** August 22, 2025

## Original Request
Phase 2, Step 2.2 of the Agents Refactoring Implementation Plan: Modernize text processing and chunking components to eliminate duplication and establish consistent interfaces.

## Thought Process
This task addresses issues in the processors module:

**Current Issues:**
- Large chunker files with similar patterns
- Duplicated parsing logic across language-specific components
- Inconsistent interfaces between processors
- Mixed responsibilities in single files

**New Architecture:**
- Pipeline-based processing with middleware support
- Unified chunker factory with strategy patterns
- Language-specific components with common base classes
- Separate parsing and enhancement concerns
- Performance optimization through caching and metrics

Target: Eliminate processing duplication and create standardized interfaces for all text processing operations.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create pipeline/ module for processing orchestration
2. Implement chunking/ module with factory and strategy patterns
3. Restructure parsing/ with unified language parser factory
4. Add enhancement/ module for text processing utilities
5. Implement middleware for caching, metrics, and validation
