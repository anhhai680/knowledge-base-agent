# [TASK037] - Create Base Classes and Common Patterns

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 22, 2025  
**Updated:** August 22, 2025

## Original Request
Phase 1, Step 1.2 of the Agents Refactoring Implementation Plan: Create base classes and common patterns to establish foundation abstractions for all agents and components.

## Thought Process
This task establishes the architectural foundation for the refactoring by creating:

1. **Base Classes**: Common agent interfaces with standardized methods
2. **RAG-Specific Abstractions**: Specialized base classes for RAG-powered agents
3. **Interface Standards**: Consistent interfaces for query processing, retrieval, and generation
4. **Pattern Libraries**: Reusable patterns for caching, monitoring, and performance optimization
5. **Model Standardization**: Unified response and query models across all components

The new `src/core/` module will provide the foundation for eliminating code duplication (currently ~20%) and establishing consistent patterns across the entire codebase.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create `src/core/` module structure with base/, interfaces/, models/, and patterns/ subdirectories
2. Implement BaseAgent, BaseLLMAgent, and BaseRAGAgent classes
3. Create RAG-specific interfaces for standardized operations
4. Develop unified response and query models
5. Implement performance patterns (caching, monitoring)
6. Create factory pattern foundations
