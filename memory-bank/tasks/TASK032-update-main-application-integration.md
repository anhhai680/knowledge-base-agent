# TASK032: Update Main Application Integration

**Status:** Not Started  
**Added:** August 19, 2025  
**Updated:** August 19, 2025  
**Phase:** 3.2 - Integration and Migration
**Parent Task:** TASK024

## Original Request
Update the main application in `main.py` to initialize the new `DiagramAgent` with required dependencies, update dependency injection, and ensure proper error handling for the enhanced diagram system.

## Thought Process
The main application needs updates to support the new DiagramAgent architecture:

1. **Dependency Injection**: Initialize DiagramAgent with required components
2. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for new agent
3. **Configuration Management**: Proper configuration for enhanced features
4. **Service Integration**: Integration with existing services

Proper main application integration ensures the enhanced diagram capabilities are accessible and reliable.

## Implementation Plan
- **Step 1**: Analyze current initialization structure
- **Step 2**: Add DiagramAgent dependency injection
- **Step 3**: Update error handling for new agent
- **Step 4**: Configure enhanced diagram features
- **Step 5**: Test main application integration
- **Step 6**: Validate service startup and health
