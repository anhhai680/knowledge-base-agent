# [TASK043] - Plugin Architecture Implementation

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 22, 2025  
**Updated:** August 22, 2025

## Original Request
Phase 3, Step 3.2 of the Agents Refactoring Implementation Plan: Implement plugin architecture for extensibility to enable modular component development and third-party integrations.

## Thought Process
This task establishes a plugin system for future extensibility:

**Plugin Architecture Benefits:**
- Modular component development
- Third-party integrations without core changes
- Easy feature addition and removal
- Runtime plugin discovery and loading
- Standardized plugin interfaces

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Abstract Plugin base class with lifecycle methods
- PluginManager for discovery, registration, and lifecycle management
- Plugin type system for categorization
- Configuration-driven plugin initialization
- Dependency injection integration

Target: Create extensible architecture for future enhancements without core modifications.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create plugin framework with base interfaces
2. Implement plugin manager for lifecycle management
3. Add plugin discovery and registration
4. Integrate with configuration system
5. Create example plugins for validation
