# [TASK021] - Query Processing Workflow Implementation

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 15, 2025  
**Updated:** August 15, 2025

## Original Request
Implement the LangGraph-based query processing workflow with adaptive retrieval strategies, cross-repository search, and parallel processing capabilities.

## Thought Process
The PRD defines a sophisticated query workflow that:

1. Analyzes query intent and complexity for strategy selection
2. Implements adaptive retrieval with depth adjustment
3. Supports cross-repository search capabilities
4. Provides parallel retrieval processing
5. Includes result expansion and quality filtering

This enhances the current simple retrieval strategy with intelligent, context-aware processing.

## Implementation Plan
- Create QueryState class with execution planning
- Implement query analysis for intent and complexity detection
- Build adaptive retrieval strategy selection
- Create parallel retrieval processing
- Add cross-repository search capabilities
- Set up query workflow graph with conditional logic
- Integrate result quality assessment and expansion
