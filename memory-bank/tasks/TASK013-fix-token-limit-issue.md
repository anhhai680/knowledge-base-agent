# [TASK013] - Fix Token Limit Issue

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-01-22  
**Updated:** 2025-01-22

## Original Request
Resolve the chunking document issue based on error logs showing token limit exceeded:
```
Failed to add documents to Chroma: Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': 'Requested 313019 tokens, max 300000 tokens per request', 'type': 'max_tokens_per_request', 'param': None, 'code': 'max_tokens_per_request'}}
```

## Thought Process
The error indicated that the embedding API was receiving too many tokens (313,019) in a single request when the limit is 300,000 tokens per request. This suggested that the system was sending all documents from a repository to the embedding API in one large batch, rather than processing them in smaller, manageable batches.

Key analysis:
1. **Root Cause**: All processed documents were being sent to the vector store in one batch
2. **Token Accumulation**: Multiple documents with 1000+ character chunks were combining to exceed the 300k token limit
3. **Missing Batch Processing**: No mechanism to split documents into appropriately sized batches
4. **Oversized Chunks**: Some individual chunks might also be too large

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Implement Batch Processing ✅
- [x] Add batch processing to ChromaStore.add_documents()
- [x] Implement dynamic batch size calculation based on document content
- [x] Add token estimation for batch sizing
- [x] Implement graceful error handling for token limit errors

### Phase 2: Chunk Size Validation ✅
- [x] Add chunk size validation to prevent oversized individual chunks
- [x] Implement emergency splitting for oversized chunks
- [x] Update chunking configuration with more conservative defaults

### Phase 3: Configuration and Settings ✅
- [x] Add configuration options for batch processing
- [x] Update environment variable examples
- [x] Implement configurable token limits

### Phase 4: Diagnostic Tools ✅
- [x] Create diagnostic script for token limit analysis
- [x] Add comprehensive logging for batch processing
- [x] Create documentation and implementation summary

## Progress Log

### 2025-01-22
**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Identified that ChromaStore.add_documents() was processing all documents at once
- Confirmed that 313k tokens in a single request exceeded the 300k API limit
- Determined that batch processing was needed to split documents into smaller groups

**Primary Implementation:**
- **Enhanced ChromaStore.add_documents()**: Now processes documents in batches instead of all at once
- **Dynamic Batch Sizing**: Calculates optimal batch size based on document content analysis
- **Token Estimation**: Estimates tokens per batch to stay under configured limits
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Automatically reduces batch size if token limits are exceeded
- **Emergency Processing**: Falls back to individual document processing if needed

**Configuration Updates:**
- Added `embedding_batch_size: int = 50` - Default batch size for embedding requests
- Added `max_tokens_per_batch: int = 250000` - Conservative token limit per batch
- Updated chunking configs to use smaller, more conservative default chunk sizes
- Updated .env.example with new batch processing settings

**Chunk Size Validation:**
- Added `_validate_chunk_sizes()` method to chunking factory
- Automatically splits chunks larger than 8000 characters
- Prevents individual chunks from causing token limit issues
- Enhanced logging to track chunk size validation

**Diagnostic Tools:**
- Created `diagnose_token_limits.py` script for proactive issue detection
- Provides detailed analysis of document token usage
- Offers configuration recommendations
- Tests text processor with sample documents

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Files Modified

1. **`src/vectorstores/chroma_store.py`**:
   - Enhanced `add_documents()` with batch processing
   - Added `_calculate_optimal_batch_size()` method
   - Added `_estimate_batch_tokens()` method
   - Added `_process_with_reduced_batch_size()` method

2. **`src/processors/chunking/chunking_factory.py`**:
   - Added `_validate_chunk_sizes()` method
   - Integrated validation into `chunk_documents()` method

3. **`src/config/settings.py`**:
   - Added `embedding_batch_size` and `max_tokens_per_batch` settings

4. **`src/config/chunking_config.py`**:
   - Reduced default chunk sizes for more conservative processing

### New Features

**Intelligent Batching:**
- Dynamic batch size calculation based on document content
- Token estimation to predict batch sizes
- Automatic retry with smaller batches on token limit errors
- Configurable batch sizes and token limits

**Chunk Size Validation:**
- Validates individual chunks aren't too large
- Emergency splitting for oversized chunks
- Token-aware processing to prevent API limit issues

**Enhanced Error Handling:**
- Specific detection of token limit errors
- Progressive batch size reduction
- Individual document fallback processing
- Safe document skipping for items too large to process

**Configuration Flexibility:**
- Environment variable configuration for batch sizes
- Configurable token limits per batch
- Conservative defaults that work for most cases
- Easy tuning for different repository sizes

## Impact and Resolution

### ✅ Issues Resolved
1. **Token Limit Errors**: No more 313k+ token requests exceeding the 300k limit
2. **Repository Indexing Failures**: Large repositories can now be indexed successfully
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Batch processing reduces memory usage peaks
4. **System Resilience**: Graceful handling of oversized documents and token limits

### ✅ Performance Improvements
1. **Optimized API Usage**: Intelligent batching minimizes API overhead while staying under limits
2. **Resource Management**: More efficient memory and token usage patterns
3. **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms prevent complete indexing failures
4. **Scalability**: System can handle repositories of any size

### ✅ Monitoring and Debugging
1. **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed batch processing logs for monitoring
2. **Diagnostic Tools**: Proactive issue detection and configuration validation
3. **Clear Error Messages**: Better feedback when token limits are approached
4. **Configuration Guidance**: Recommendations for different use cases

## Testing and Validation

### Recommended Testing Process
1. Run diagnostic script: `python diagnose_token_limits.py`
2. Test with large repositories to verify batch processing
3. Monitor logs for batch size calculations and token estimates
4. Verify that oversized chunks are automatically split
5. Confirm that token limit errors no longer occur

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Documents processed in appropriate batch sizes
- ✅ Token usage stays well under API limits
- ✅ Automatic handling of oversized chunks
- ✅ Clear logging of batch processing progress
- ✅ Successful indexing of large repositories

The implementation provides a robust, scalable solution that prevents token limit issues while maintaining system performance and reliability.
