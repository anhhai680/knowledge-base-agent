# [TASK019] - Chunking Workflow Implementation

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 15, 2025  
**Updated:** August 15, 2025

## Original Request
Implement the LangGraph-based chunking workflow with parallel processing, quality validation, and adaptive strategy selection based on file complexity analysis.

## Thought Process
From the PRD analysis, the chunking workflow is a critical component that needs to:

1. Analyze file complexity to determine optimal chunking strategy
2. Support parallel semantic chunking using AST parsing
3. Implement quality validation with regeneration capability
4. Provide fallback strategies for poor quality chunks
5. Include comprehensive state management and monitoring

This workflow replaces the current extension-based chunking with a more intelligent, adaptive approach.

## Implementation Plan
- Create ChunkingState class with LangGraph optimizations
- Implement analyze_file_complexity node
- Build parallel_semantic_chunking node with AST integration
- Create validate_chunk_quality node with regeneration logic
- Implement fallback_chunking node for poor quality scenarios
- Set up chunking workflow graph with conditional edges
- Add performance monitoring and execution tracking
