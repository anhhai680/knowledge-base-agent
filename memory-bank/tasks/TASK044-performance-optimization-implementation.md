# [TASK044] - Performance Optimization Implementation

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 22, 2025  
**Updated:** August 22, 2025

## Original Request
Phase 3, Step 3.3 of the Agents Refactoring Implementation Plan: Implement general performance optimization including caching strategies and async processing capabilities.

## Thought Process
This task implements system-wide performance optimizations:

**Performance Strategies:**
- Centralized cache management with TTL and LRU eviction
- Function result caching with decorators
- Async processing for concurrent operations
- Batch processing for multiple items
- ThreadPoolExecutor for CPU-bound tasks

**Implementation Focus:**
- CacheManager for unified caching across components
- AsyncProcessor for concurrent task execution
- Performance decorators for easy optimization
- Configurable caching strategies
- Memory-efficient batch processing

Target: Improve overall system performance through optimized caching and async processing.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create centralized cache management system
2. Implement async processing framework
3. Add performance decorators and utilities
4. Integrate caching with existing components
5. Validate performance improvements
