# TASK025: Fix _compile_diagram_patterns Method

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** August 19, 2025  
**Updated:** August 19, 2025  
**Phase:** 1.1 - Immediate Fixes
**Parent Task:** TASK024

## Original Request
Fix the `_compile_diagram_patterns` method in `src/agents/agent_router.py` to remove duplicate regex patterns, fix inconsistent escaping, add enhanced mermaid-specific patterns, and optimize pattern compilation for performance.

## Thought Process
The current `_compile_diagram_patterns` method has several technical issues:

1. **Duplicate Patterns**: Identical regex patterns reducing efficiency
2. **Inconsistent Escaping**: Mixed use of `\\b` and `\b` causing compilation issues
3. **Limited Mermaid Support**: Missing specific mermaid detection patterns
4. **Performance Issues**: Unoptimized pattern compilation affecting response time

This is a foundational fix that will improve the accuracy and performance of diagram request detection.

## Implementation Plan
- **Step 1**: Analyze current pattern duplicates and inconsistencies
- **Step 2**: Remove duplicate regex patterns
- **Step 3**: Standardize escaping to use `\b` consistently
- **Step 4**: Add enhanced mermaid-specific patterns
- **Step 5**: Optimize pattern compilation for performance
- **Step 6**: Test pattern detection accuracy

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
