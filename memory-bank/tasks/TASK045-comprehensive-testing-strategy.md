# [TASK045] - Comprehensive Testing Strategy

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** August 22, 2025  
**Updated:** August 22, 2025

## Original Request
Phase 4, Step 4.1 of the Agents Refactoring Implementation Plan: Implement comprehensive testing strategy covering unit, integration, performance, regression, and quality assurance testing.

## Thought Process
This task establishes comprehensive testing for the refactored system:

**Testing Levels:**
- Unit tests for all refactored components
- Integration tests for cross-component functionality
- Performance tests for benchmarking improvements
- Regression tests for functionality preservation
- Quality tests for RAG response accuracy and consistency

**RAG-Specific Testing:**
- Chain-of-Thought reasoning validation
- ReAct agent functionality testing
- Query optimization effectiveness
- Response quality and hallucination detection
- Performance benchmark compliance

Target: Achieve >85% test coverage while validating all advanced RAG features are preserved.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create comprehensive test structure
2. Implement unit tests for all refactored components
3. Add integration tests for system workflows
4. Create performance and regression test suites
5. Implement RAG-specific quality testing
