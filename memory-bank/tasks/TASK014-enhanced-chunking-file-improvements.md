# [TASK014] - Enhanced Chunking File Improvements

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** August 13, 2025  
**Updated:** August 13, 2025

## Original Request
Improve the chunking system to better handle different file types and enhance code understanding. Focus on semantic chunking strategies that preserve code structure and context while optimizing for retrieval quality.

## Thought Process
The current chunking system works but can be enhanced for better code understanding:

1. **File Type Awareness**: Different programming languages have different structures and should be chunked accordingly
2. **Semantic Preservation**: Maintain logical code boundaries (functions, classes, modules)
3. **Context Retention**: Ensure important context like imports and dependencies are preserved
4. **Performance Optimization**: Balance chunk size and overlap for optimal retrieval

This work builds on previous chunking improvements (TASK010) and addresses specific needs for file-type optimization.

## Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1**: Analyze current chunking performance and identify improvement areas
- **Phase 2**: Implement file-type specific chunking strategies
- **Phase 3**: Enhance metadata preservation during chunking
- **Phase 4**: Optimize chunk size and overlap parameters
- **Phase 5**: Test and validate improvements with real codebases

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 60%
