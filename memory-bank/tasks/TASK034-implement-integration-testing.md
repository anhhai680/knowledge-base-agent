# TASK034: Implement Integration Testing

**Status:** Not Started  
**Added:** August 19, 2025  
**Updated:** August 19, 2025  
**Phase:** 4.2 - Testing and Validation
**Parent Task:** TASK024

## Original Request
Implement comprehensive integration testing in `tests/test_diagram_features.py` covering end-to-end diagram generation, multi-repository support, various diagram types, and response quality validation.

## Thought Process
Integration testing ensures the enhanced diagram system works correctly as a complete solution:

1. **End-to-End Flows**: Test complete diagram generation workflows
2. **Multi-Repository**: Validate cross-repository diagram generation
3. **Multiple Types**: Test all supported diagram types together
4. **Quality Validation**: Ensure response quality meets standards

Integration testing validates the system works correctly in real-world scenarios.

## Implementation Plan
- **Step 1**: Design end-to-end test scenarios
- **Step 2**: Implement diagram generation integration tests
- **Step 3**: Create multi-repository test scenarios
- **Step 4**: Test various diagram types integration
- **Step 5**: Implement response quality validation
- **Step 6**: Performance integration testing
