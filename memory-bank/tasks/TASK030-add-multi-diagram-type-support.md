# TASK030: Add Multi-Diagram Type Support

**Status:** Not Started  
**Added:** August 19, 2025  
**Updated:** August 19, 2025  
**Phase:** 2.3 - Diagram Agent Creation
**Parent Task:** TASK024

## Original Request
Add multi-diagram type support to `src/agents/diagram_agent.py` including enhanced sequence diagrams, flowcharts, class diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, and component diagrams.

## Thought Process
Currently the system only supports basic sequence diagrams, limiting its usefulness:

1. **Single Type Limitation**: Only sequence diagrams supported
2. **No Type Detection**: Cannot determine appropriate diagram type
3. **Limited Use Cases**: Restricts system applicability
4. **Missing Diagram Categories**: No support for structural or behavioral diagrams

Multi-diagram type support will transform the system into a comprehensive diagram generation tool.

## Implementation Plan
- **Step 1**: Design diagram type detection system
- **Step 2**: Implement enhanced sequence diagram generation
- **Step 3**: Add flowchart generation capabilities
- **Step 4**: Implement class diagram generation
- **Step 5**: Add entity-relationship diagram support
- **Step 6**: Implement component diagram generation
- **Step 7**: Test all diagram types

| 30.6 | Component diagram generation | Not Started | - | System architecture diagrams |
| 30.7 | Test all diagram types | Not Started | - | Comprehensive validation |

## Target Files
- `src/agents/diagram_agent.py` (primary)
- `src/utils/diagram_generators.py` (new utility)
- `tests/test_multi_diagram_types.py` (new test file)

## Success Criteria
- Automatic diagram type detection implemented
- Enhanced sequence diagram generation
- Flowchart generation functional
- Class diagram generation working
- Entity-relationship diagram support active
- Component diagram generation operational
- All diagram types tested and validated

## Progress Log
### August 19, 2025
- Created task to track multi-diagram type support
- Part of TASK024 Phase 2 diagram agent creation
- Depends on TASK028 and TASK029 completion
