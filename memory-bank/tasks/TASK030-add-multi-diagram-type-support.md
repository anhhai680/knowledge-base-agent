# TASK030: Add Multi-Diagram Type Support

**Status:** Not Started  
**Added:** August 19, 2025  
**Updated:** August 19, 2025  
**Phase:** 2.3 - Diagram Agent Creation
**Parent Task:** TASK024

## Original Request
Add multi-diagram type support to `src/agents/diagram_agent.py` including enhanced sequence diagrams, flowcharts, class diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, and component diagrams.

## Thought Process
Currently the system only supports basic sequence diagrams, limiting its usefulness:

1. **Single Type Limitation**: Only sequence diagrams supported
2. **No Type Detection**: Cannot determine appropriate diagram type
3. **Limited Use Cases**: Restricts system applicability
4. **Missing Diagram Categories**: No support for structural or behavioral diagrams

Multi-diagram type support will transform the system into a comprehensive diagram generation tool.

## Implementation Plan
- **Step 1**: Design diagram type detection system
- **Step 2**: Implement enhanced sequence diagram generation
- **Step 3**: Add flowchart generation capabilities
- **Step 4**: Implement class diagram generation
- **Step 5**: Add entity-relationship diagram support
- **Step 6**: Implement component diagram generation
- **Step 7**: Test all diagram types

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Progress Log
### August 20, 2025 - TASK COMPLETED âœ…
- **COMPLETED**: Multi-diagram type support implementation
- **Implemented Features**:
  - Enhanced diagram type detection with specific keywords for each type
  - Flowchart generation with flow control pattern analysis
  - Class diagram generation with OOP structure detection
  - Entity-Relationship diagram generation for data models
  - Component diagram generation for architectural visualization
  - Comprehensive pattern extraction utilities (`DiagramPatternExtractor`)
  - Advanced Mermaid code generation (`MermaidGenerator`)
  - Robust error handling and edge case management
  - Full test suite with 14 comprehensive tests (all passing)

- **Technical Achievements**:
  - Created `src/utils/diagram_generators.py` with pattern extraction and mermaid generation
  - Enhanced `DiagramAgent` with multi-type support and intelligent type detection
  - Implemented automatic diagram type selection based on query analysis
  - Added fallback diagram generation for "no patterns found" scenarios
  - Fixed type detection conflicts (sequence vs flowchart keyword overlap)
  - Comprehensive error handling for vector store failures
  - Integration with existing SequenceDetector for enhanced sequence diagrams

- **Quality Assurance**:
  - All 14 tests in `test_multi_diagram_types.py` passing
  - Pattern extraction working for Python, JavaScript, Java, and C# code
  - Mermaid generation producing valid syntax for all diagram types
  - Error scenarios properly handled with graceful degradation

### August 20, 2025
- Started implementation of multi-diagram type support
- Reviewed existing DiagramAgent structure - foundation already in place
- Type detection system already implemented (subtask 30.1 complete)
- Beginning implementation of pattern extraction methods for each diagram type
- Next: Implement flowchart pattern extraction and mermaid generation

### August 19, 2025
- Created task to track multi-diagram type support
- Part of TASK024 Phase 2 diagram agent creation
- Depends on TASK028 and TASK029 completion
