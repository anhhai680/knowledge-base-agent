# TASK029: Implement Enhanced Code Retrieval

**Status:** Not Started  
**Added:** August 19, 2025  
**Updated:** August 19, 2025  
**Phase:** 2.2 - Diagram Agent Creation
**Parent Task:** TASK024

## Original Request
Implement enhanced code retrieval functionality in `src/agents/diagram_agent.py` featuring query optimization for diagram generation, semantic code analysis, repository-specific filtering, and code pattern detection.

## Thought Process
Current code retrieval for diagrams is basic and doesn't leverage the advanced RAG capabilities:

1. **Basic Retrieval**: Simple similarity search without optimization
2. **No Semantic Analysis**: Missing semantic understanding of code structures
3. **Limited Filtering**: No repository-specific or context-aware filtering
4. **Pattern Detection**: No specialized pattern detection for diagram generation

Enhanced code retrieval will significantly improve diagram generation quality and relevance.

## Implementation Plan
- **Step 1**: Design enhanced retrieval architecture
- **Step 2**: Implement query optimization for diagrams
- **Step 3**: Add semantic code analysis capabilities
- **Step 4**: Implement repository-specific filtering
- **Step 5**: Add code pattern detection for diagrams
- **Step 6**: Test retrieval quality and performance
