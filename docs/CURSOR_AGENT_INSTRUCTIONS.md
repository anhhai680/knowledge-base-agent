# Cursor Agent Instructions

## Location

The Cursor agent instructions are located in the `docs/cursor-agent/` directory:

```
docs/cursor-agent/
├── README.md                           # Overview and integration guide
├── cursor-agent.instructions.md        # Core Cursor agent rules and workflows
└── cursor-copilot-compatibility.md     # Detailed compatibility guide with examples
```

## Purpose

These instructions ensure that the Cursor agent maintains 100% compatibility with GitHub Copilot while following all memory bank workflows and rules. The key is maintaining consistency across development environments and ensuring that developers can seamlessly switch between VS Code and Cursor IDE without any workflow disruption.

## Quick Start

1. **Read the instructions**: Start with `docs/cursor-agent/cursor-agent.instructions.md`
2. **Follow the workflows**: Implement all memory bank workflows exactly as specified
3. **Maintain compatibility**: Ensure all patterns match GitHub Copilot exactly
4. **Validate regularly**: Test compatibility across both environments

## Key Principles

- **100% Compatibility**: All workflows must work identically in both IDEs
- **Memory Bank Compliance**: Follow all memory bank workflows without exception
- **Pattern Consistency**: Code generation patterns must match exactly
- **Continuous Validation**: Regular testing and monitoring for compatibility

## For More Information

See the comprehensive documentation in `docs/cursor-agent/` for detailed implementation guides, validation checklists, and troubleshooting information.
