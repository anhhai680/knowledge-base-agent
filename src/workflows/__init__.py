LangGraph Workflows Package

This package contains the LangGraph workflow infrastructure including:
- State definitions for workflow management
- Workflow nodes for different processing stages  
- Workflow graphs for orchestrating complex processes
- Utilities for state persistence and monitoring

All workflows are designed to run in parallel with existing LangChain components
to ensure zero breaking changes during migration.
